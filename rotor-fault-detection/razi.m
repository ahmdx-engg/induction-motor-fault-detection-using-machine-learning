%Before you can interact with data in the ensemble, you must create functions that tell the software how to process the data files to read variables into the MATLAB workspace and to write data back to the files. For this example, use the following supplied functions.
%readMemberData — Extract requested variables stored in the file. The function returns a table row containing one table variable for each requested variable.  
%riteMemberData — Take a structure and write its variables to a data file as individual stored variables.
